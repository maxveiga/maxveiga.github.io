		This is the Amphicar 770. It was made between the years of 1961-1967 designed by a German engineer by the name of Hanns Trippel. 
		Inspired by the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen from WWII, its amphibious capabilities allow it to move at an upwards of 7 knots in the 
		water and 70mph on land giving it the model name 770.
